# SpotHole Project

SpotHole is a full-stack web application designed to detect potholes in images using Neural Nets. 
It integrates machine learning, a modern web stack, and a database to offer a seamless user experience for pothole detection.
The project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify potholes in images and provides the detection results through a user-friendly interface.

## üöÄ Features
- **CNN-powered Pothole Detection**: 
  - A CNN model detects potholes in uploaded images. The model is integrated with FastAPI for inference, which is connected to the backend.
- **Frontend**: 
  - Built with **React** and **Vite**, offering a fast and responsive UI for users to upload images and view results.
- **Backend**: 
  - **Node.js + Express** for handling user authentication, API requests, and MongoDB interactions.
  - **FastAPI** for serving the CNN model, processing images, and sending detection results.
- **Database**: 
  - **MongoDB** stores user information, image data, and detection results.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get started with SpotHole, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Sai-Krishna-Nair/SpotHole-Project.git
  cd SpotHole-Project
```

### 2. Install dependencies

- For the **frontend** (React + Vite):
```bash
  cd client
  npm install
```

- For the **backend** (Node.js + Express):
```bash
  cd server
  npm install
```

- For the **AI backend** (FastAPI):
```bash
  cd FastAPI_server
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Start the servers

Run all the servers concurrently with the following command:
```bash
    npm run start
```

This command will:
- Start the **Node.js server** on `http://localhost:3000`
- Start the **React frontend** on `http://localhost:5173+`
- Start the **FastAPI AI backend** on `http://localhost:8000`

### 4. Access the App

Once the servers are running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to interact with the frontend and start uploading images for pothole detection.

## Installation Instructions for MongoDB and React

### 1. Install MongoDB

If you don't have MongoDB installed, follow the instructions below based on your operating system:

#### **For Ubuntu / Debian:**

```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y mongodb
```

#### **For Fedora:**

```bash
  sudo dnf install -y mongodb-server
```

#### **For macOS (using Homebrew):**

```bash
  brew tap mongodb/brew
  brew install mongodb-community@5.0
```

#### **For Windows:**

1. Download and install MongoDB from the official [MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).
2. Follow the installation steps as per the instructions for your system.

After installation, you can start MongoDB with the following command:
```bash
  sudo systemctl start mongodb  # Linux
  brew services start mongodb   # macOS (Homebrew)
```

#### **Install Node.js and npm:**

- **For Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
```

- **For Fedora:**
```bash
  sudo dnf install -y nodejs
```

- **For macOS:**
```bash
  brew install node
```

- **For Windows:**
1. Download the latest version of Node.js from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Follow the installation instructions.

Once installed, verify the installation by running:
```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
```

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **API**: FastAPI

## üîß Development Setup

- **Concurrent Server Running**: The `npm run start` command will run all three servers at once using `concurrently`. This enables you to have your frontend, backend, and AI services running simultaneously.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- **Frontend**: The React app is configured to use Vite for fast builds and hot reloading during development.
- **Backend**: The Node.js backend is connected to MongoDB to store user information and image data.
- **Model**: The CNN model is hosted with FastAPI and serves pothole detection results based on the images uploaded by users.
